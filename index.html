					Centre to ban 138 betting apps, 94 loan lending apps with Chinese links
				</h1>
				<div>
					<p>NEW DELHI: In a major crackdown, the Central gov- ernment has initiated the process to ban and
						block 138 betting apps and 94 loan lending apps with Chinese links on an 'urgent' and
						'emergency' basis, top government sources said on Sunday. Ministry of Electronics and
						Information Technology (MeitY) is learnt to have taken the decision based on the recommendations
						of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). As per sources, the MHA recommended the MeitY this week
						to ban and block these apps, and the Ministry subsequently initi- ated the process as per com-
						munication. The move was taken after confirming that these apps attract Section 69 of the IT Act
						as they contain material which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India. The action
						behind the move is based on several complaints of extortion and harassment of common peo- ple
						who had availed small amounts of loans through the mobile apps being run by those entities and
						per- sons. It is learnt that these apps are the brainchild of Chinese nationals who hired
						Indians and made them directors in operation. As per inputs, desperate individuals are lured
						into taking on a loan and then jacked up the interest by up to 3,000 per cent annually.</p>
					<p>
						When the debtors were unable to repay the interest, let alone the entire loan, individuals
						representing these apps started harassing those in debt. They sent them lewd messages,
						threatening to release their morphed pho- tos and shaming them with messages to their contacts.
						The matter came into the spotlight after a spate of sui- cides, particularly in Andhra Pradesh
						and Telangana, by those who opted for such loans or lost money to bet- ting apps. States like
						Telangana, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh as well as central intelligence agencies had then asked the
						Union Home Ministry to take action against these apps, sources said. Based on these inputs, the
						MHA started analysing 28 Chinese loan lending apps six months ago. However, they found that 94
						apps are available on e- stores and that others are working through third-party links.
